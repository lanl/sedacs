# SEDACS documentation

Scalable Ecosystem, Driver, and Analyzer for Complex Chemistry Simulations (SEDACS) enables
massively parallel atomistic simulations that can seamlessly integrate with a diverse range
of available and emerging quantum chemistry codes at different levels of theory.

Supporting ab initio, semiempirical quantum mechanics (SEQM),and coarse-grained flexible
charge equilibration (ChEQ) models, this is a unified framework to simulate and analyze the
MD of complex chemical systems and materials.

SEDACS also enables the anlysis of trajectories using novel graph-based ML schemes and
quantum-response information to capture and visualize hidden, non-local quantum features
that cannot be seen from the geometry alone.

Finally, SEDACS provides advanced mixed-precision electronic structure solver library that
uses AI-hardware accelerators.

Our target customer is a Computational Chemist domain expert working on complex materials
systems or developing new quantum capabilities that can easily be deployed at scale.

We hence provide transparent implementations that closely follow a “white-board” physics and
mathematics presentation. The threshold to understand and work with this codebase for a
domain expert is purposely kept low.
